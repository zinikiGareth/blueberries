In order to count as a valid blueberry demo, any demo must:

* Define an overall "application"
* Define at least three separate "blueberries"
* Have one path that forces a significant chain of nested blueberries:
Application/NestedBlueberry/IFrameBluebery/NestedBlueberry/EnvelopeData
* Require templates
* Require at least one of the BlueberryPunnets to be used
* Include a pop-up window
* Require at least one service to be provided inline
* Require render and data services at a minimum
