## Introduction

Because of the desire to share blueberries, and the idea that they are
"fundamental units of composition", it is important to be able to
package a BlueberryBrand to appear to be a single autonomous unit.  In
practice, it may be necessary to deliver it in several distinct pieces
(JavaScript, CSS, icons, images, etc), but the goal should be to allow
all of those pieces to be stored "in the same place" and identified as
a single root.

This includes things like modularizing JS & CSS files using AMD files
and a special div class to identify the CSS units.

It also involves how we describe that packaging in the Ziniki world.

Also how we upload files.
